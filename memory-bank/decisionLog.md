# Decision Log

## Purpose
This file documents significant decisions made during the project's development, including the rationale behind each decision and any alternatives considered. This helps maintain context and understanding of why certain approaches were chosen.

## How to Use This File
1. **Adding New Decisions**
   - Add new decisions at the top
   - Include date and context
   - Document alternatives considered
   - Explain the rationale
   - Note any trade-offs

2. **Format**
   ```markdown
   ## [Date] - Decision Title
   **Context:** Brief description of the situation
   
   **Decision:** What was decided
   
   **Alternatives Considered:**
   - Option 1: Pros and cons
   - Option 2: Pros and cons
   
   **Rationale:** Why this decision was made
   
   **Trade-offs:** Any compromises or considerations
   ```

## Decision History

### [2024-06-06] - Performance Optimization Approach
**Context:** Need to improve performance of report checking and data fetching

**Decision:** Implement async I/O with aiohttp and parallel processing

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Synchronous processing with threading
  - Pros: Simpler implementation
  - Cons: Less efficient, more resource intensive
- Batch processing
  - Pros: Reduced API calls
  - Cons: Higher memory usage, slower response time

**Rationale:** 
- Async I/O provides better performance for I/O-bound operations
- Parallel processing improves CPU utilization
- Modern Python async features are well-suited for this use case

**Trade-offs:**
- Increased code complexity
- Need for careful error handling
- More complex debugging

### [2024-06-06] - Dependency Management
**Context:** Need to standardize dependency management

**Decision:** Use req.txt instead of requirements.txt

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Keep both files
  - Pros: More flexibility
  - Cons: Confusion, maintenance overhead
- Use requirements.txt only
  - Pros: Standard approach
  - Cons: Less comprehensive

**Rationale:**
- req.txt contains more complete set of dependencies
- Single source of truth for dependencies
- Simpler maintenance

**Trade-offs:**
- Non-standard filename
- Need to document the choice

## Notes
- Update this log for all significant architectural or design decisions
- Include both successful and reverted decisions
- Link to relevant issues or discussions when applicable
- Note any decisions that might need revisiting in the future
