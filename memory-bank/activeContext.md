# Active Context

## Current Focus
- TCIA case fetching and management
- Report detection and handling
- Performance optimizations
- User experience improvements

## Recent Changes
1. **New Scripts Added**
   - Added `scanner.py` for TCIA collection scanning
   - Added `nonivfc.py` for non-IV contrast case handling
   - Fixed logger issues in `fc.py`

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented asynchronous network I/O using `aiohttp`
   - Added parallel processing for patient filtering
   - Enhanced memory management with monitoring and garbage collection
   - Implemented live timer display during report checks

3. **User Experience**
   - Added prompt to return to main menu or quit when no cases are found
   - Improved feedback during report checks
   - Enhanced report detection logic

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Updated project to use `req.txt` for dependencies

## Active Decisions
1. **Architecture**
   - Modular design with separate scripts for different functionalities
   - File-based storage with caching
   - Python-based implementation with async support
   - Comprehensive logging system

2. **Development**
   - Local development first
   - Incremental implementation
   - Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Tasks**
   - Test new scripts and report detection logic
   - Gather user feedback on new functionality
   - Document new features and changes

2. **Short-term Goals**
   - Implement additional performance improvements
   - Set up testing framework
   - Create basic utilities
   - Enhance report detection accuracy

## Current Considerations
1. **Technical**
   - Performance monitoring
